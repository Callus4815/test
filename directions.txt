Development of an Agent Checklist
Install Virtualization program on development machine.
Install a windows VM into Virtualization program.
Within Windows VM, map a network drive to local box with the Agent files that were checked out from code.novadine.com/projects/AG/repos/agent
Download all Dependencies for NDAgent. They are listed in DEPENDENCIES.TXT except the files under Build. Private Assemblies should be placed in home directory of the mapped network drive.


Start Posi-Dev VM.
Make sure that a drive is mapped to the Agent files.
In the command line switch to that drive -- "X:"
Then run c:\python27\python.exe NDAgent.py --debug --popup-errors
find NDAgent_*.log files "dir /s NDAgent_*.log"

Then configure YAML file in c:/ProgramData/NovaDine/NDAgent to include necessary parameters. (POS system, Username, Password, Site URL...etc.)
Restart Agent.
Place an order at test store.(If the test store is set up, that is)
See if order is created in order management system, and that is has turned gray.
Run export. Monitor NDAgent log files.



Committing and pushing changes work flow:
commit normally:
$git add .
$git commit -m 'message'

then to push....
$git fetch
$git rebase origin/positouch
then check the log to see if the path origin/positouch is there
$git push
